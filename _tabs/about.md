My name is Nick Carbone, and I currently work as a Sr. Solutions Architect @ AWS. Over the course of my career, I have worked in different roles and have been blessed with the opportunity to work with an extensive range of technologies, ranging from Cloud, Virtualization, VDI, Storage and various Automation technologies to name a few. I love to solve problems and am always excited at the opportunuty to help customers to transform and modernize their technology platforms.

The main purpose of this blog is to document certain projects, and issues that I encounter during my day-to-day responsibilities. I am also a big proponent of sharing information with the public, as I have personally reaped the benefits from those who have come before me, and from many of my colleagues from across the world. I hope that through this blog, other technology professionals will be able to solve any problems that they run into. If you have any questions, please feel free to reach out to me via twitter, [@vCarbs_.](https://twitter.com/@vcarbs_)
