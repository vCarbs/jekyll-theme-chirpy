I have been meaning to write this post for over a week now but between being out of town and moving it’s been delayed. So here I am sitting in my car, listening to the ‘In Tech We Trust’ podcast, waiting for the clock to hit 9:00 before I walk into the office on my first day.

For the past few years, I’ve wanted to make the transition from Customer to Partner; and for the past few years, I’ve known that in order to get there, I would need to procure a certain array of skillsets and would need significant Enterprise-grade experience. Fortunately, the last few years spent at PennyMac allowed me to do just that. It wasn’t always easy, but the opportunities were always there. I was given the opportunity to lead the Virtualization Services Team, implement some very cool solutions, and design for some serious growth. We scaled the VDI environment from 300 users all the way out to 2,000 users, all while completing a data center migration project in under four months. The list of accomplishments is many, but what I am most proud of is that the people I worked with ended up becoming family. The friendships that we forged will last a lifetime.

As tough as it is to say goodbye to this family, I am extremely excited to begin the next chapter of my career as a Data Center Virtualization Consultant for Red8- and in doing so, realizing the materialization of a long-standing personal goal. After spending eight years on the Customer side of the fence, I cannot wait to see what the Partner world will show me. The opportunity to work with customers to solve their business challenges brings a level of excitement that is hard to describe.

And with that, it’s time to walk into the office and start this new journey.
